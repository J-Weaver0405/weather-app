Write a cli that adds the following functionality 
- allows the user to specify which fields to view with the presence of the existing flags,if there is no flag, then show all 
(Temperature) --temp
(atmospheric pressure) --pressure
(humidity) --hum
(description) --desc

- add a function that can take a text file of city names and it displays all the temperatures and then the averages of all the above  
(for this to work, you will have to refactor the code)
- add any other feature you see as useful!


After you have written the CLI, use chmod to make the python file executable using chmod.
